# Degea / Truesec onboarding scripts
Scripts are only tested in Powershell v7 and later. Requires Microsoft.Graph module.

Download or clone the repo, then run scripts in order 1-4. PDF files are for reference.

Due to a lack of programmatic support the steps in part 4 still need to be executed manually.
